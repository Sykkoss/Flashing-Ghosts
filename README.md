A student game project done in South Korea at Keimyung University (2019-2020). It was done in 2 months with 4 members in the team. We had a lot of fun making this game, so don't hesitate to give feedback or give some advice :)

Upon arriving, he tells you that you need to hunt Boos for him to have coins at the arcade...
You decide to help him since you are already here, disapointed and angry nonetheless.
